itquery --- An interface to query ItemTracker from BioNumerics
==============================================================
Version: ``2.0.8``


About
-----
itquery is a graphical interface to display location information of strains, 
frozen stock's and DNA's stored in a LIMS system (ItemTracker) within a strain 
database maintained in BioNumerics. An "ItemTracker ID" links data related to a 
strain in both databases. 

Features
--------

* Display location information of Strains, Frozen stock's or DNA's in the freezer.
* Display and set/unset the selection status of Strains, Frozen stock's or DNA's in the LIMS database. 
* Display additional information related to an item in both databases (Saved 
  between sessions).
* Get all items marked as selected in the LIMS database.
* Cherry picking view displays status of sequencing (Finished, Repeat, Picked). 
  Filter by user or sequencing status. 
* Export sequence trace information or DNA information related to a strain as 
  a CSV file.

Demo
----
Run file :file:`itquery_demo.py`

The main program is ``itquery.py`` would require modification to handle a
specific data structure. A sample of all data structures used for the demo is 
contained in :file:`data.json`.
